With N=1000, there is still significant stochasticity.  Some epidemics have earlier
peaks than others.  When many of these are averaged together, the final outcome
is that the average has a lower, broader peak than a typical epidemic.  In
this case it tends to make the Erdos-Renyi network for <K>=50 look like a better
fit for the homogeneous_pairwise model.

Increasing N to 10000 will eliminate this.
