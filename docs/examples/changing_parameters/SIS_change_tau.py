r'''This code demonstrates a change in parameters at time t1.  To do this, it
will run to time t1 and then stop, and restart with the new parameters.

To demonstrate that stopping and restarting doesn't do anything weird, we first
run to time t0, stop, and then restart with the original parameters.  The resulting
simulation should just look like nothing changes.

Another way to do this is through writing a custom transmission rate
function into the nonMarkovian SIS code.  I hope to do this at a later time.
